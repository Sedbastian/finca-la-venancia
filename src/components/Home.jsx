    In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.

    They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.`;
